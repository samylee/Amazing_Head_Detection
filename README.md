# Algorithm efficiency
| Image Size | min_size | CPU(i7-9700K) Speed/FPS | CPU(ARMv7 @1.4GHz) Speed/FPS |
|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| 320x240  | 12x12 | 6ms/166.7 |35ms/28.6|
| 640x480  | 12x12 | 23ms/43.5 |190ms/5.3|
| 800x600  | 12x12 | 42ms/23.8 |    -    |
# Test experience
If the image size is larger than `720p`, it is recommended to scale the image `below 720p`!
